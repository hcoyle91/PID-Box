## Overview

Problem/Goal:
Our goal in this project is to create a box that contains a motor, a potentiometer, arduino, a wheel, and a photointerrupter. We aim to make the motor spin the wheel, and using the potentiometer, manually control the speed at which the wheel spins. Using the photointerrupter, we will measure the speed at which the wheel is going in RPM. We will power our circuit using a battery pack. We hope to complete our project in 5 weeks and have a very sturdy, well working PID box.

#### Materials/Constraints

* Motor
* Photointerruptor
* Potentiometer
* SPDT switch
* Acrylic Plastic
* LED
* 6xAA Battery Pack
* Arduino
* LCD screen
* Wires
* The switch activates the motor
* The switch activates the LED
* The potentiometer controls the speed at which the motor spins.

Constraints:
We want to complete our project before the end of the quarter, and with winter break interrupting the quarter, we may be pressed for time when we return. 
This will be our first time writing PID code, so it may be difficult for us.
This project will be the first time we have laser cut and 3D print since last year, so it may be difficult for us when the time comes to complete these tasks.
