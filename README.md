## Overview

Problem/Goal:
Our goal in this project is to create a box that contains a motor, a potentiometer, arduino, a wheel, and a photointerrupter. We aim to make the motor spin the wheel, and using the potentiometer, manually control the speed at which the wheel spins. Using the photointerrupter, we will measure the speed at which the wheel is going in RPM. We will power our circuit using a battery pack. We hope to complete our project in 5 weeks and have a very sturdy, well working PID box.
